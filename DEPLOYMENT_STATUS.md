# Deployment Status & Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ All code changes committed and pushed to main branch
- ✅ Railway configuration updated with proper build commands
- ✅ Frontend and backend builds tested locally and working
- ✅ Dependencies resolved with legacy-peer-deps

## Recent Changes Made
1. **Fixed Role-Based Dashboards**: Removed unnecessary tabs for each user role
2. **Fixed Super Admin Login**: Improved authentication flow and access control
3. **Fixed Deployment Configuration**: Added proper Railway build configuration
4. **Resolved Dependencies**: Fixed npm conflicts with TypeScript versions

## Railway Configuration
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (builds both frontend and backend)
- **Start Command**: `npm start` (starts the server)
- **Build Process**: 
  1. Install all dependencies (server + client)
  2. Build React frontend
  3. Start Express server serving both API and static files

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If deployment is still not showing:
1. **Check Railway Dashboard**: Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. **Manual Deploy**: Try triggering a manual deployment from Railway dashboard
3. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any build errors in Railway logs
4. **Verify Environment**: Ensure NODE_ENV is set to 'production'

### Common Issues:
- **Build Timeout**: Railway might timeout during the build process
- **Memory Issues**: Large builds might need more memory
- **Dependency Conflicts**: The legacy-peer-deps should resolve this

### Super Admin Login Credentials:
- **Email**: `superadmin@personacentric.com`
- **Password**: `superadmin123`
- **URL**: `/super-admin` (after login)

## Next Steps
1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. If needed, trigger manual deployment
3. Monitor build logs for any errors
4. Test the deployed application

## Files Modified for Deployment:
- `railway.json` - Added buildCommand
- `nixpacks.toml` - Added build configuration
- `client/.npmrc` - Added legacy-peer-deps
- `.npmrc` - Added legacy-peer-deps
- `client/package.json` - Added ajv dependency
