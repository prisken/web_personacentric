## 🔧 **Database Tracking**

### **Payment Failure Tracking**
```sql
-- Track consecutive failed payments
UPDATE user_subscriptions 
SET 
    consecutive_failed_payments = consecutive_failed_payments + 1,
    last_payment_attempt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status = CASE 
        WHEN consecutive_failed_payments >= 2 THEN 'past_due'
        ELSE status 
    END
WHERE user_id = 'user_uuid' AND payment_failed = true;

-- Check for suspension threshold
UPDATE user_subscriptions 
SET 
    status = 'suspended',
    suspension_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE consecutive_failed_payments >= 3 
AND status != 'suspended';
```

### **Payment Status Queries**
```sql
-- Get users approaching suspension
SELECT 
    u.name,
    u.email,
    us.consecutive_failed_payments,
    us.last_payment_attempt,
    us.next_billing_date
FROM users u
JOIN user_subscriptions us ON u.id = us.user_id
WHERE us.consecutive_failed_payments >= 1
AND us.status != 'suspended'
ORDER BY us.consecutive_failed_payments DESC;

-- Get suspended users
SELECT 
    u.name,
    u.email,
    us.suspension_date,
    us.consecutive_failed_payments
FROM users u
