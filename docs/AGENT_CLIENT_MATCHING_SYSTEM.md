# Agent-Client Matching System Design

## 1. Overview
The Agent-Client Matching System is designed to intelligently pair clients with financial agents who best fit their needs, preferences, and goals. The system leverages structured agent profiles and a client intake quiz to generate high-quality matches, improving client satisfaction and agent engagement.

## 2. Matching Flow

### **A. Agent Onboarding & Profile Creation**
1. **Agent Registration:** Agents sign up and verify their identity.
2. **Profile Completion:** Agents fill out a detailed profile including:
   - Areas of expertise (e.g., retirement, investment, tax)
   - Years of experience
   - Certifications & licenses
   - Languages spoken
   - Preferred client types (e.g., young professionals, retirees)
   - Communication preferences (in-person, video, phone, digital)
   - Availability (days/times)
   - Location (if relevant)
   - Personal bio & photo
3. **Profile Review:** Admin reviews and approves agent profiles before they are eligible for matching.

### **B. Client Intake & Matching**
1. **Client Quiz:** Clients answer a series of questions about their financial goals, preferences, and situation.
2. **Matching Algorithm:** The system compares client answers to agent profiles using weighted criteria.
3. **Match Presentation:** The client is shown a shortlist of best-matched agents, including match scores and key profile info.
4. **Contact/Booking:** The client can contact or book a session with a matched agent.

## 4. Matching Algorithm (Example)
- Each quiz answer is mapped to agent profile fields.
- Assign weights to each criterion (e.g., goal match = 30%, communication = 20%, language = 20%, etc.).
- Calculate a match score for each agent.
- Return top N agents with the highest scores.

**Example:**
- Client wants "Retirement Planning" in Chinese, prefers video calls.
- Agent A: Retirement, speaks Chinese, offers video calls → 95% match
- Agent B: Investment, speaks English, offers phone only → 60% match
